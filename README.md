### [Session Buddy](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/session-buddy/edacconmaakjimmfgnblocblbcdcpbko?hl=en)

Probably, everyone was in a situation when it's needed to open a lot of tabs in browser while investigating or working on something, especially a new technology or platform. You open a new window and try to browse as lot as possible. However, you don't have enough time to finish the work and you need to switch to something else, but you don't want to find this info agian and open all of those tasks.

Session Buddy is perfect solution to let you don't keep all of this tabs in memory and in the same time you don't need to open these tabs manually later on when you come back. Session Buddy can do it for you with saving sessions and ability to restore them.
